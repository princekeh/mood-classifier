# Mood Classifier

A tiny command-line tool that tries to guess mood from a sentence using keywords.

## How it works
- Looks for simple positive and negative words.
- Adds up matches and returns Positive / Negative / Neutral.
- No ML, no external libraries — deliberately simple.

## Run it
1. Save `mood_classifier.py`
2. Run:
3. Type sentences and see the result. Type `exit` to stop.

## Limitation
This is basic and misses a lot (sarcasm, double negatives, etc.). It was made as a learning exercise.
